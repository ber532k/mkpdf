# Roadmap

I. e. features that *might* be included in some future release.

- reintegrate bib input  file support into the current rewrite
- support ``template: xyz`` in bib.md config file
- support for reference-docx files as template (allowing
  for markdown -> docx -> pdf conversion using lowriter)
